A data package with information about (initially 21st Century, released) independent video games created by Swiss game developers or studios.

Provided as a [Simple Data Format Data Package](http://dataprotocols.readthedocs.io/en/latest/simple-data-format.html), this dataset was compiled in preparation for the [OpenGLAM.ch 2017 Hackdays](http://glam.opendata.ch).

The goal of this data package is to  make it easier for participants to discover the data, to make it available in a mirror and in multiple formats.
